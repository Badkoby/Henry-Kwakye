      <p>Category: Data Cleaning & Analysis | Date: Jan 2023</p>

    <h2 class="fade-in-section">Project Overview</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-section">This project involved cleaning and analyzing a large dataset to identify key trends and insights. The primary goal was to prepare the data for subsequent modeling and to extract actionable information that could inform business decisions. The dataset presented several challenges, including missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.</p>

    <h2 class="fade-in-section">Methodology & Tools Used</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-section">The analysis was conducted using Python, primarily leveraging the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and cleaning. SQL was used for initial data extraction and querying. Statistical methods were applied to identify outliers and understand data distributions. Data cleaning involved imputation of missing values, normalization of data types, and removal of erroneous entries.</p>

    <h2 class="fade-in-section">Key Findings & Visualizations</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-section">Key findings revealed significant correlations between variables X and Y, and an unexpected trend in Z. These insights were presented through a series of visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The cleaned dataset proved to be significantly more reliable for predictive modeling. Challenges included handling large volumes of data efficiently and interpreting ambiguous data points.</p>
